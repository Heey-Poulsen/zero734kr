### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hello World! Iâ€™m a MERN Stack Developer interested about discord bot's and how to make a good CSS Styles.


- [x] ~~Iâ€™m learned MERN Stack Development.~~
- [ ] Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on discord bot projects or related platform development.
- [ ] Iâ€™m looking for help with MySQL(or its can be MariaDB), to learn about SQL databases.


- How to reach me: ``Discord: zero734kr#5005`` or ``Email: zero734kr@gmail.com``
- Fun fact: 279 commits in public repos, 1623 commits in privates repos :thinking: 

Sadly almost of my development projects are privates, like [lostarkbot](https://github.com/lostarkdiscord) project, and that's why I can't write here about it... Iâ€™m thinking about to make one to public in days from now.
