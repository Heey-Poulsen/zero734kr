### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hello World! Iâ€™m a *semi*-MERN Stack Developer interested about discord bot's and how to make a good CSS Styles ðŸ˜‚. Currently I'm using bootstrap to facilitate my development life, but I prefer to modify some things in css.


- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning MERN Stack Development.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on discord bot projects or related platform development.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with MySQL(or its can be MariaDB), to learn about SQL databases.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: 
> Discord: ì œë¡œã…£Brazil#5005<br>Email: zero734kr@gmail.com<br>
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: "zero", or "ì œë¡œ" in korean.
- âš¡ Fun fact: ~~í•˜ì•… React.js ì¡°ì•„~~


Sadly almost of my development projects are privates, like [lostarkbot](https://github.com/lostarkdiscord) project, and that's why I can't write here... Iâ€™m thinking about to make one to public from days from now.
